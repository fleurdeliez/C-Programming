/*
Consider a scenario where you need to write a function that modifies the values in 
an array: 
1. Declare an integer array of size 5 and initialize it with some values. 
2. Write a function called multiplyByTwo that takes an integer pointer as an argument 
and  multiplies each element in the array by 2.
